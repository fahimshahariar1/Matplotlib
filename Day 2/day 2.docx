On Day 2, we are going to look into an example workflow of matplotlib

The basic workflow would be first to import matpoltlib

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Then we need to create some data such as
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [11, 22, 33, 44]

Then we will give the figure a size (width, height)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10))

Then plot the data in the axes
ax.plot(x,y)

After that give some titles and labels to make it look better for visualisation
ax.set(title="Simple Plot",
      xlabel="x-axis",
      ylabel="y-axis")

Finally save it to your preferred location 

fig.savefig("\\Matplotlib\\Images/sample-plot.png")

This is the basic workflow of Matplotlib
