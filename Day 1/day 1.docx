Day 1 of Matplotlib.

Today we will look into the absolute basics. Importing and plotting and ways of plotting

In Matplotlib there are two ways of plotting
1. Pyplot
2. Object Oriented Plotting

The Pyplot one as per the official documentation of Matplotlib is likely to be less flexible

On the other hand, the object-oriented one is more robust and recommended In general, use the explicit interface over the implicit pyplot interface for plotting.

In the notebook we have used 3 types of plotting but going forward we will be using the 3rd method
