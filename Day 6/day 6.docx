I know this might be bit confusing so on Day 6 we are going to just try to recap all the things but on a different Dataset

Today we will be using a Heart Diesease dataset that you can find in the resources folder
first as usual we will import pandas as read the csv. as it is a big dataset we will use the head() function to get the first 5 rows of data from the dataset
heart_disease = pd.read_csv("heart-disease.csv")
heart_disease.head()

Then supposedly if we want to plot a histogram using the Age column of the dataset we can do it by using this command 
heart_disease["age"].plot.hist()

Now, what if we plot all the columns and data together?
To do that we will use heart_disease.head().plot(figsize=(10,30), subplots = True, kind = "hist");
this command where we are mentioning pandas to plot all the subplots into one figure

This might not be such an useful thing but definitely necessary for other works in the future
