So on day 3, we will be learning how we can make figures from numpy arrays

For that, first we need to import the libraries 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

then we will create some data x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100) using numpy.
Remember, if you don't know about something press shift+tab or read the documentation
In this case, linspace = Return evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval

Here, 0 is the start value, and 10 is the stop value, and it will create 100 values in between

Then, we will plot it 
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, x**2) and this will return a basic line shape figure

We can also create a scatter plot using the same data 
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(x, x**2)

Finally, we can create a bar figure as well

car_prices = {"Toyota": 100,
             "Honda": 200,
             "BMW": 500}

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.bar(car_prices.keys(), car_prices.values())

The main difference here is the ax.bar/scatter/plot. ,See we are just changing this part, and based on that, we are getting different types of figures
