So on day 3, we will be learning how we can make figures from numpy arrays

For that, obviously, first we need to import the libraries 
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

then we will create some data x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100) using numpy.
remember if you don't know about something press shift+tab or read the documentation
In this case linspace = Return evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval

here 0 is the start and 10 is the stop value and it will create 100 values in between

Then we will plot it 
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, x**2) and this will return a basic line shape figure

We can also create a scatter plot using the same data 
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(x, x**2)
