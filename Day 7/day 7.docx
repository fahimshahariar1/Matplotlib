We have used the pandas plotting system or methods to work and plot different figures. But now we will be looking at the OO / object-oriented method of Matplotlib to plot more advanced figures.

Let's first create a figure from the heart disease data using OO method mixed with pyplot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6))
over_50.plot(kind="scatter",
            x="age",
            y="chol",
             c="target",
            ax=ax);

This gives us a good figure but still, it's missing lots of things. So lets now make one using the OO method from scratch

We will first create the figure and size of it
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

then plot the labels and values that need to be used
scatter = ax.scatter(x=over_50["age"],
                     y=over_50["chol"],
                     c=over_50["target"])
