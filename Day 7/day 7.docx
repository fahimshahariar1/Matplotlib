We have used the pandas plotting system or methods to work and plot different figures. But now we will be looking at the OO / object-oriented method of Matplotlib to plot more advanced figures.

Let's first create a figure from the heart disease data using OO method mixed with pyplot
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,6))
over_50.plot(kind="scatter",
            x="age",
            y="chol",
             c="target",
            ax=ax);
