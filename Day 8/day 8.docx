Now we have created different types of figures.

what if we want to customize it? Try different styles and colors etc.
Yes we can do that as well

We can run this command plt.style.available to check what styles we have available and then 
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
car_sales["Odometer (KM)"].plot();
if we just use it and run it will give you a different type of figure


what if we want to change the color of the plots and legends. we can do that as well by using

scatter = ax0.scatter(x=over_50["age"],
                     y=over_50["chol"],
                     c=over_50["target"],
                     cmap = "winter")
the cmap parameter. we can use summer or winter and that will give you different colors

you can also find the official documentation to know more about the colorings
