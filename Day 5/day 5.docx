Today, we will see how we can create figures or plots using Pandas Dataframe. Usually pandas will be our go to system to make the figure and plots

To do that, we will use our trusted car_sales.csv, which we used before in Pandas. which you can also find in the resources tab
after importing the car_sales file we will try to remove the characters that we have in the price column because we will need to do some artihmetic opearations on them.

So we can remove them using the .replace() function of Pandas
car_sales["Price"] = car_sales["Price"].str.replace('[$, .]', '', regex=True)
Remember to always use regex=True unless it will show error. 

After running this you will see the extra characters are removed but the extra zeros that we had after the period that is also added which now giving us a wrong value.
So, to remove the extra zeros we will use car_sales["Price"] = car_sales["Price"].str[:-2]
This will remove the extra 2 zeros from the back

Next up we will add two new columns
1. Date Range - car_sales["Sale Date"] = pd.date_range("1/1/2025", periods=len(car_sales)). Date range will give us a range of dates according to the set periods in this case for each row of our car_sales
2. Cumulative Sum / cumsum - car_sales["Total Sales"] = car_sales["Price"].astype(int).cumsum(). Cumulative Sum or cumsum will add all the values of a particular column and give us the total value

Now we can simply plot this.

look carefully in order to plot this we are not importing or using matplotlib; we are doing it by Pandas itself
, car_sales.plot(x = "Sale Date", y = "Total Sales");
This will give us a simple plot 

car_sales.plot(x = "Odometer (KM)", y = "Price", kind="scatter");
and this would give us a scatter plot using pandas

Isn't this awesome.

Similar to scatter and normal plot we can also plot bar and histogram 
Which we are going to look into today
