On day 4, we are going to continue looking at other figures 

The first thing that we are going to look at is how we can make the bar that we created yesterday in a horizontal line.

to do that ax.barh(list(car_prices.keys()), list(car_prices.values())) we will use this command. 
The difference between this and the previous one is for this we need to convert each of the key and value as list 

Next we will see how can we created Histogram.
We can create histogram by this command
x = np.random.randn(1000)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.hist(x)

where we are using randn from numpy which Return a sample (or samples) from the "standard normal" distribution.
